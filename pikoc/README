Note: This code has been tested only on Ubuntu Linux 12.04.

Prerequisites:
	1) NVIDIA CUDA 8.0 (currently available as a Release Candidate)
	2) LLVM and Clang version 3.8
	3) gcc and g++ version 4.9 or newer
	4) OpenGL

Build pikoc:
	1) Download LLVM and Clang version 3.8.0 from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html
	2) Build LLVM and Clang using the instruction at http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html
	3) cd <piko_repository>/pikoc
	4) run './configure Linux' and edit pikocPaths.in so that the paths are correct for your 
	   CUDA 8.0 instillation and LLVM install and source paths.
	5) run 'make' to build pikoc

Building and running the sample pipelines:
	1) cd <piko_repository>/samples/<pipeline>
	2) run 'make' to build the pipeline

Troubleshooting:
	1) Issues building sample pipelines:
		 The Makefiles for the sample pipelines contain hardcoded paths to some of the 
		 required tools (e.g. CUDA and g++).  You may need to edit these Makefiles so that
		 the paths are correct for your system.
	2) When running a pipeline, I get a CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY error:
	   In the file <piko_repository>/api/include/internal/datatypes.h, the #defined value for
	   'MAX_NUM_PRIMS' controls the memory footprint of the pipeline. Try lowering this number
	   so that the memory footprint stays within your GPUs available memory.
	   Note: We have only tested a certain range of values for MAX_NUM_PRIMS, so artifacts
	   may occur with other values.
